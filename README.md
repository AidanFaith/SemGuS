EECS 700 Special Topics: Program Synthesis

In this repository, you will find our Python reimplementation of the semantics-guided synthesis (SemGuS) solver described in the paper led by Jinwoo Kim. 

To narrow the scope of our project, we decided to focus only on the bitvector problems. Our SemGuS solver will generate and correctly implement the specified bit manipulation operation on ‘input_vector’, producing the desired ‘output_vector’.
